# Paddy Leaf Disease Detection

## Description

Paddy Leaf Disease Detection is a web application designed for the identification of common diseases affecting paddy leaves. The project utilizes transfer learning to enhance disease detection accuracy and covers five types of leaf diseases: Tungro, Hispa, Leaf Blast, Brown Spot, and Bacterial Leaf Blight. Additionally, the model provides a classification for healthy leaves. The application is hosted on Streamlit, making it accessible to users for easy and interactive disease detection.
